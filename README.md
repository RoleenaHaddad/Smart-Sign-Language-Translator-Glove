This project offers a practical solution that addresses the limitations of previous solutions by integrating advanced technologies into a wearable device. Most existing solutions depend on cameras, external computers, internet connections, or huge pre-recorded gesture libraries, which makes them heavy, slow, and not private at all. So we decided to build something completely different: a lightweight, wearable smart glove that translates Arabic Sign Language into spoken or written Arabic in real time, with everything running directly on the glove itself, with no phone, no internet, and no extra devices.

The proposed solution features the following:
*Advanced Sensor Fusion: An integrated combination of finger flex sensors for precise finger positioning, and an MPU6050 hand movement and direction tracking unit (IMU) is used. This integration ensures the highest levels of accuracy in recognizing both static and dynamic gestures compared to single-sensor systems.
*Edge-Fastening Processing: We decided to run the entire TinyML model directly on the ESP32 S3 chip. By doing the processing right on the hardware, we cut down the lag to less than 500 milliseconds, which is crucial for a real-time conversation. This setup is great because it makes the glove completely independent; you don't need a constant internet connection or a powerful phone to handle the heavy lifting; the glove does it all on its own.
*Communication and Output System: Once the glove identifies a sign, it sends the data over Bluetooth to a custom app we built. The app acts as the voice of the system; it picks up the text and instantly converts it into clear speech. This makes the whole communication loop feel natural, turning hand movements into spoken words almost as fast as they are signed.

Overall, the glove is comfortable, discreet, and actually practical for daily use: in class, on the bus, at the mall, anywhere. It gives users a natural and independent way to communicate with non-signers without needing to pull out a phone or ask someone for help. Everything happens on-device, so it’s fast, private, and works even offline.
